Python interview friendly Questions-

1) What is Python?

Python is high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language used for automation, data, web and cloud tasks.
high level human readable
interpreted code is executed line by line
OOP support class and object
Cross platform runs any OS like windows, linux, macOS etc.
Open Source free to use and has large community support

2) What is different data types in python?

It defines what kind of data a variable can store.
a)int store a whole numbers single value so concept of order doesn't apply IMMUTABLE x=10
b)float store a decimal value single value so concept of order doesn't apply IMMUTABLE x=3.14
c)stre stores multiple value of characters ORDERED IMMUTABLE s="Aman"
d)list store multiple values of any data type
ORDERED
MUTABLE
l=[1,2,3]

e)tuple store multiple values of any data type
ORDERED 
IMMUTABLE
t=(1,2,3)

f)dict store multiple data value in key value pair
ORDERED (Python 3.7+)
MUTABLE
d={"a":1}

g)set store multiple unique value
UNORDERED
MUTABLE
s={1,2,3}

h)bool store True or False
ORDERED
IMMUTABLE
flag-True

i) None= represent no value or empty state
ORDERED
IMMUTABLE
y=None

#only list,dict, set are mutable

3) why list, dictionary, string, tuple, set considered as data structure but int, float, bool, not?
int, float, bool can store only single value so they are called primitive data types 
whereas list, dictionary, string, tuple, set can store and organize multiple value which makes them data structure.

4) What is variable and valid variable name?

A variable is a named storage in Python that holds a value. variable must be start with a letter or underscore
- in variable name you can include number but not in start and cannot include hypens(-) in naming

5) What is the correct way to write a comment in python?
Using Hash (#This is a comment)

6) Operator in Pythons

Arithmetic=> +,-,*,/,%,***,//
Comparison=> ==, =, >, <, >=, <=
Assignment=> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Logical=> and, or, not
Bitwise=>&,|,^,~,<<,>>

10) OOPS in Python

-What is OOPS?
O0Ps (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming approach based on and classes 
and objects to organize and manage code.

-What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects that defines properties (variable) and methods (function).

What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class that represents a real world entity.
Real life example Animal is a Class and A Dog is object

-What is init_method?
init is a constructor that initialize a object when an object is created

-What is self?
self refers to current object and is used to access class variables and functions

-What is Encapsulation?
It means binding properties and methods together and restricting them to direct access

-What is Inheritance?
It allows one class to reuse properties and methods of another class
Types-
Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

-What is Polymorphism?
It means same method name but it shows a different behaviour

-What is Abstraction?
It hide implementation details and show only the essential features

What is Method Overriding?
It means same method name and same parameter but in child class also called Runtime polymorphisms

-What is Method Overloading?
Python does not support method overloading directly, but it can be achieved using default arguments
It means same method name but different parameter in same class also called compile time polymorphism

-How to achieve Abstraction in Python?
Using abstract classes and abstract methods

-What is an Abstract Class?
An abstract class is a class you cannot create an object of. It is used as a parent class.

-What is an Interface in Python?
An interface is like a rule book It only tells what to do, not how to do.

-Difference Class vs Object?
Class
Blueprint
Logical
No memory

Object
Real instance
Physical
Takes memory

-What is super()?
super() is used to call the parent class constructor from the child class

-What are access modifiers in Python?
Public-> var (no underscore) can be accessible anywhere
Protected-> var (single underscore) only accessible inside a class and their child class
Private-> var (double underscore) only accessible inside the same class

-What is Constructor?
A special method that runs automatically when an object is created.
Python supports only one constructor per class

11) Programs Practice

For Loop Uses Iterating over a List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and with range() i in list, 
i in tuple, i in String, i in Dictionary
-if it is attached with a list, tuple, string then its iterating elements but 
if it is not then its generating number based on () inside condition

i in range(5) #01234
i in range(1,6)#12345
i in range(0,10,2) #0 2 4 6 8

-using with length () function
i in range(len(list)) Aman and its length=4 #A(0)
                                             m(1)
                                             a(2)
                                             n(3)

While Loop Uses=
-repeat code unless condition is true as soon as condition is false stop that
i=1
while i<=5:
print(i)
i=i+1

Output-1
       2
       3
       4
       5 (stop)

-Infinite loop because condition never become false
i=0
while i>=0:
     print(i)
     i=i+1
Output-  0
         1
         2
         never stop infinite time run
