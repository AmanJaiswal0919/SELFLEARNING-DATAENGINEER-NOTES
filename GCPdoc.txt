Quest)What is GCP?      
      
GCP stand for Google Cloud Platform is a suite of cloud computing service offered by google 
that allows individuals or organizations to build, deploy, manage application and data on google infrastructure.      
      
Ques2) Difference between Cloud Provider and On Premises?          
Cloud Provider is a company that offers computing services(like servers, storages, databases, networking) 
over the internet instead of you having to your own physical computer.      
Ex- GCP ANS, Azure      
On Premises is a physical location where your computing services(like servers, storages, databases, networking) 
are physically located. It has two types Server Room (On Premises) Datacenter (On Premises) a dedicated room, 
small space company building, large space      
      
On Premises         
Your own the server          
you hire the IT people          
you rent space      
      
Cloud Provider           
Company own the server Company hire the IT people           
Company own the space    
    
Ques3) Difference between GCP, Azure and AWS?     
GCP-9%, When focus on Data, AI ML     
Azure- 32%, When using Microsoft Tools     
AWS-44%, When need wide range of services    
    
Region- A geographical location where your infrastructure is hosted    
Ex- Delhi, Fact- one region can have multiple zones    
Zone A Sub location inside a region    
Ex- South Delhi, Fact- one zone can have multiple data center    
Data Center- It is a physical location where infrastructure is hosted    
Ex- South Delhi, Fact- one data center can have multiple server    
    
Server- A single physical or virtual machine (computer) that provide services 
to other client Computer over a network Difference-    
Computer (Personal machine) provide service only to you made for you    
Server (Public machine) provide service to many made for many    
    
Ques4) Deployment Model    
    
Public CloudTrain (GCP, AWS, AZURE)    
a) you pay based on how long you use, you share the train with many others, 
you don't worry about maintenance Its handled by the railway. Same as Public Cloud You Pay for Usage, 
Share Resources and Provider Manages Everything.    
    
Private Cloud Own Car (VMWARE, IBM CLOUD)    
a) you pay a huge amount initially to buy the car, Later on you can use it anytime and 
much as you want without worry about money, you are responsible for maintenance. 
Same as Private Cloud High setup cost but full control and privacy    
    
Hybrid Cloud Booked Cab only for yourself (Google Anthos help to connect on prem servers with google cloud platform)    
a) you don't need to pay huge amount initially but you need share it with others (Private Cloud). 
Same as Hybrid Cloud to pay how long you use (Public Cloud), But during your ride it feels private 
because you don't You use both private and public setups depending on need flexible and cost efficient.    
    
Ques5) Service Model     
Iaas (Compute Engine) you manage infrastructure OS and application and its code Cloud Provides server, storage.    
Paas (App Engine) you manage application and its code only and Cloud Provides server, storage and 
also handle infrastructure 
Saas (Gmail) cloud manage everything you have to just use the application. 
(Infrastructure. Means Virtual Hardware Resources (CPU, Memory Disk, Networking))    
    
Ques6) Technical Terms        
AutoScaling - Automatically Add new server (VMs) when traffic is high and remove server when traffic is low        
Service Name MIG (Managed Instance Group)      
Load balancing - Distribute traffic across many server (VMs) so no single machine crashes       
Service Name Cloud Load Balancing       
Database Replication- Primary (Master) handle all writes, Replicas (Copies of Primary) handle read queries       
Service Name Cloud SQL       
Caching Store - Frequently access data (developer decides which data)       
make operation faster       
Service Name Cloud CDN or MemoryStore    
    
Ques7)What is IAM?    
    
IAM Stand for Identity and Access Management Controls Who can access GCP resource and what action they can perform. 
Types of IAM Role-    
    
1) Basic Role    
Always applied on project-level, Provided by Google All resources of all service in the project (Editor, Viewer, Owner), 
IAM Only roles/viewer read everything Compute Engine (VMs), Cloud Storage (buckets), BigQuery(datasets), 
IAM (Service Accounts) etc.    
    
2) Predefined Role    
can be applied on project-level, resource-level, object-level, Provided by Google All resources of one service in the project, 
Both IAM and ACL    
    
-roles/storage.admin full control over resource and object Permissions=roles/storage.objectAdmin, 
roles/storage.objectCreator, roles/storage.objectViewer    
    
-roles/storage.objectAdmin full control over object Permissions-roles/storage.objectCreator, 
roles/storage.objectViewer    
    
-roles/storage.objectViewer read only access of object Permissions-storage.objects.get, 
storage.objects.list    
    
-roles/storage.objectCreator can upload object but not read or delete Permissions-storage.objects.get, 
storage.objects.list, storage.objects.create    
    
-roles/compute.admin-full control over compute engine resources (VMs.networks.disks) 
Permissions-roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1, roles/compute.networkAdmin, roles/compute.securityAdmin, 
roles/compute.storageAdmin, roles/compute.viewer    


3) Custom Role    
can be applied on project-level, resource-level, object-level, you defined these roles 
All resources of one service in the project for specific action, IAM Only    
    
a)Storage ObjectUpload and Viewer Allow user to upload, read files but not delete 
Permissions storage.objects.create, storage.objects.get, storage.objects.list    
    
b) Read-Only ComputeViewer-Allow operation team to only view VM configurations not start/stop 
Permissions=compute.instances.get, compute.instances.list, compute.disks.get, compute.networks.get    
    
Example your requirement is upload object, view, download, list files but dont delete object, 
bucket or change permission so here there is no predefined role present which is fullfil this requirement    
    
our requirement only upload and view object inside the bucket    
    
roles/storage.admin give you full control over bucket like delete or change permission 
roles/storage.objectAdmin give you full control over object like delete or permission     
roles/storage.objectViewer allow only you to view object    
roles/storage.objectCreator allow only to create object    
roles/compute.admin allow you to do anything in bucket    
so here we create custom role for our requirement i.e StorageObjectUploadandViewer    
    
IAM Roles in Details-There are three level of Permission Project(apna-project-1909), 
Resource(bucket) and object(a specific file in bucket)    
    
Scenario- you want to give your colleague access to manage objects inside a specific bucket in Google Cloud Storage?    
    
Step1- Identify the key pieces Member your colleague google account (colleague@gmail.com) 
Resource The specific cloud storage bucket(my-bucket-2000)    
Action create, update, delete object    
Step2- Choose the right role among all Predefined roles-Storage Object Viewer can only read 
object Storage Object Creator can only upload object Storage Object Admin-can create, update, delete 
object Storage Admin full control over all buckets+object    
Step3- Create a Policy Binding Member+Role->Resources colleague@gmail.com + Storage Object Admin->my-bucket-2000    
Using google CLI    
-Resource level binding gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-bucket-name\ --member="user:colleague@gmail.com"\    
--role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"    
-Project level binding    
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project-id\ --member="user:colleague@gmail.com"\    
--role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"    
    
Note- Suppose If you have two buckets let's say bucket-2000, bucket-5678 then 
you have to run resource level binding command for each bucket one by one 
just replace my-bucket-name variable with bucket-2000 then bucket-5678 
If you do Project level binding it is less secure because its impact other services in your project 
also not just cloud storage  
  
QuesS) IAM VS ACL     
  
What is ACL?    
-Access Control List provide access control at resource, object level 
but mostly used in object level IAM Provide access control at project, resource, object level 
but mostly used in project, resource level    
    
ACL ROLES in GCP Storage    
READER- can read only    
WRITER- can upload, edit, delete    
OWNER- full control: read, write, delete and managed ACL Permission 
(add new acl permission, modify existing acl, remove existing acl)    
    
Through IAM    
gcloud storage objects add-iam-policy-binding gs://news-archive-bucket/breaking-news.jpg\    
--member="allUsers"\    
--role="roles/storage.objectViewer"    
Through ACL     
gcloud storage objects add-acl-binding breaking-news.jpg\    
--bucket-news-archive-bucket\    
-member-allUsers\    
--role-READER    
Note-gs://used for path(location) but you don't need in ACL with gcloud command    
    
Ques9) What is Service Account?    
    
A service account is a special type of account in GCP that belongs to a service 
not a human user to securily access GCP resource Managed Instance Group (MIG)    
    
-Managed Instance Group is a collection of identical VM instance that are managed 
as a single unit In this you define a template (VM Configuration- machine,    
os & storage, network, startup script) 
-MIG do creates, delete or replaces VM instance based on that template    
-MIG can autoscale (add/remove VMs instance on traffic load) and self-heal (if one vm crashes, replace it with another)    
-MIG support load balancing so traffic is distributed across healthy VMs.    
    
Ques10) Difference between VM, VM instance, Image?    
The idea of a virtual computer, The template/blueprint that defines what computer will look, 
The actual running computer you created from the image    

Image Include OS(eg. Ubuntu, Windows, Centos, Debian), Disk Configuration    
    
Public Image-google give you ready made template(like ubuntu, window, debian), 
cant modify/save them as your own, basic configuration (os+minimal tools)    
    
Custom Image-start from VM creation using a public image, you can modify for extra configuration 
(like mysql, Java), and save it as custom image before saving it is public, 
whenever you need more VM with same setup so you can launch directly from this template
    
Shared Image-It is basically a custom image that you share with others
(like in teams, department inside your organisation) It is solved the problem in custom image 
every user so just share them that custom image in group so everyone don't need to launch now    
it is called shared image after sharing    
    
Ques11) Compute Engine (Iaas)    

1) What is it?    
Compute Engine is a gcp service that provide virtual machine (VMs)   
  
2) When to use?      
When you need control over OS      

a) Security Testing -> need full control over Computer A cyber security company wants 
to test for client system, application, website how viruses effect for this you need full access on computer 
create vms install different os because we don't know which os client system, website or application will use 
after test that virus on different os one by one    
b)run old software -> need special os    
A bank still uses an old accounting application that for this you need special os (window server 2008) 
choose that special os and run the old software only run on window server 2008 create vms and choose 
that special os and run the old software    
    
Ques12) App Engine (Paas)    
    
1) what is it?    
It let you build and run your web application without managing server    
    
2) When to use?    
Run or build application without managing server (VMs)    
need automatic scaling    
use specific programming languages (Python, Java, Node.js, PHP etc.)    

3) Different Types of App Engine Environment?    
App Engine Standard-> Fully Serverless    
don't manage any VMs or Server uses google pre made environment    
-less control (cant install anything extra), Fast, cheap and scales to zero when no traffic    
    
App Engine Flexible-> Partially Serverless    
Run on VMs managed by Google    
More Control(can install anything you need), Slower, Costlier and At least 
one ym instance always running (can't scale to zero)    
    
When to use App Engine Flexible over Cloud Run?    
App needs long running background tasks such as video processing cloud run has max 60min request 
time limit while app engine flexible allows unlimited request time limit    
    
Ques13)Cloud Run(Paas)    
    
1) what is it?    
Run Containerized application in a serverless environment    
    
2) When to use?    
Run your containerized application without managing server (VMs) need automatic scaling, 
don't worry about any specific language    
    
Container- It stores application code, all dependencies (libraries, runtime environment,packages), 
system tools and setting(basic os commands and configuration)    
Folder-It stores only your application code    
Container-uses a docker image to run    
Dockerfile-Instruction to build docker image    
Docker image-a blueprint/ template of your application    
Container a running form of that image    
    
How it works when you build a container you write a docker file inside the container 
at the running time of conatiner that docker file create a docker image which help container to run    
    
Difference Suppose if you build the same app using a folder and a container and 
both will work fine on your local machine but when you move them to another system 
or any cloud platform In folder case will fail due to missing libraries, tools or settings 
while container case wil work perfectly fine everywhere(whether it any cloud platform or any other system) 
because container already includes everything the app needs.    
    
Ques14) Cloud Storage

Ques20) Quick Summarise all of these    
    
1) Very High Scalability and Very High Availability Cloud Spanner or Bigtable    
Very High Scalability and High Availability BigQuery    
High Scalability and Very High Availability Firestore    
Moderate Scalability and Availability Cloud Storage    
Low Scalability and Availability Cloud SQL so whenever you see strong consistency 
or scaling or availability just tick on spanner or bigtable    
    
2 ) latency Bigtable<spanner<firestore<sql<bigquery<cloud stoarge    
real time data update low latency (fast response)+push notification+real time listeners    
low latency fast reply when you ask    
real time push instant updates without you asking    
Only Firestore have these because it is real time database    
so whenever you see real time just tick on firestore    
    
3) whenever you see time series or lot, sensor kind thing just tick on bigtable    
   
4) SQL, Spanner, BigQuery Relational (use SQL), Firestore, Bigtable= Non Relational (NoSQL),    
Cloud Storage Not a database Cloud SQL Relational, OLTP, small to medium apps    
Cloud Spanner Relational, OLTP, Large apps, horizontal scaling    
BigQuery SQL engine for analytics not for apps, OLAP    
Firestore Non Relational, document db(json key value type storage)    
Bigtable Non Relational, wide column db(excel sheet with unlimited columns+extreme performance)    
Cloud Storage-object storage (object image, video, pdf)
